# Project Birdnest â€“ Backend
This is a [pre-assignment](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/) for a Reaktor Developer Trainee application. This project is licensed under MIT License.

Take a look at the app [here](https://spring-moon-3266.fly.dev/).

## Folder Structure

- The main imported functions are in the `src` directory.
- The `lib` directory contains services that are used by the `src` and the `index.js`.
- The `models` directory contains database models.
- The `util` directory contains general configuration.

## Backend Logic

- The `index.js` sets a 2 second interval to repeatedly call `updateDatabase`.
- Then `updateDatabase` calls `scrapeAndParse` which pulls the drone/pilot data from the API and returns the processed data to `updateDatabase`.

- Next `updateDatabase` uses the map function to call `SaveAll` on every pilot in the nzdPilots array.
- `SaveAll` saves all the pilots in the database.
- `SaveAll` checks if the data contains a new `closestDistance`. If it finds one, it saves it to the database.

- The `index.js` uses a [websocket](https://github.com/websockets/ws) to establish a connection to the frontend.
- When the connection is ready, the `index.js` calls `getAllFromDb` which returns the all needed data from the database.
- The data is then sent to the frontend via the websocket.
- The `index.js` sets a 2 second interval to repeatedly do this gathering and sending of data.

## Database

- The database is provided by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/index.html) is used for interacting with it.
- The database automatically removes the pilot data in 10 minutes (since the document was last updated).
- The `closestDistance` collection is limited to only one document. That way whenever a new document is added, the old one is removed.

## Frontend

The `index.js` configures [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) to serve static files from the `build` directory, which contains the production build of the frontend.
